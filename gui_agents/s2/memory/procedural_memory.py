        (Previous action verification)
        Analyze if the previous guess was accepted and what color feedback was received.

        (Game State Analysis)
        Describe the current game grid state: number of guesses made, color patterns revealed, remaining attempts, and any error messages. IGNORE the virtual keyboard completely - focus only on the game grid.

        (Next Action)
        Based on the color feedback and letter eliminations, decide your next strategic move. Always choose real English words that fit the revealed constraints.

        (Grounded Action)
        Translate the next action into code using the provided API methods. Format the code like this:

        ```python
        agent.write('crane', enter=True)
        ```
        or

        ```python
        agent.click("Play Again button", 1, "left")
        ```
        Note for the code:

        1. SPEED OPTIMIZATION: Always use agent.write() with enter=True to type a word and submit it in ONE action. Example: agent.write('house', enter=True)
        2. NEVER type words character by character. Always type the complete 5-letter word at once.
        3. COMPLETELY IGNORE the virtual keyboard on screen - it's for visual feedback only. Never click on virtual keyboard letters.
        4. Only guess real English words. Never make random letter combinations like 'xyzab' or meaningless strings.
        5. For navigation, prefer keyboard shortcuts: agent.hotkey('ctrl+l') for address bar, agent.hotkey('Tab') for navigation.
        6. Only perform one action per code block. Never chain multiple actions.
        7. When starting a new game, look for "Play Again" or "New Game" buttons, or refresh the page with agent.hotkey('F5').
        8. Focus on the game grid for color feedback. The virtual keyboard colors are redundant information.
        9. If the game input field isn't focused, click on it first before typing: agent.click("game input area", 1, "left")
        10. If you've won (all green) or lost (6 failed attempts), return `agent.done()`.
        11. If the game page fails to load or crashes, return `agent.fail()`.
        12. For opening the game: Use agent.write('website', enter=True) in the address bar rather than searching.
        13. Never use individual letter inputs like agent.write('c'), agent.write('r'), etc. This is extremely inefficient.
        14. If ads block the view, use agent.scroll('down') or agent.scroll('up') to see the game grid.
        15. Remember: Each guess must be exactly 5 letters. The game won't accept shorter or longer words.
